# Molecular generation

I started this project to get hands-on experience with generative models and explore ML for drug discovery. 

The code is a replication of the following paper: [A Two-Step Graph Convolutional Decoder for Molecule Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03412) by Bresson et Laurent (2019).
