# Molecular generation

[![Molegen architecture](https://www.justin-silver.com/assets/img/molegen/flowchart.png)](https://www.justin-silver.com/posts/molegen/)

I started this project to get hands-on experience with generative models and explore ML for drug discovery. 

The code is a replication of the following paper: [A Two-Step Graph Convolutional Decoder for Molecule Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03412) by Bresson et Laurent (2019).

Documentation for the project is hosted on [my portfolio website](https://www.justin-silver.com/posts/molegen/). Interactive widgets are hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/j-silv/molegen).
