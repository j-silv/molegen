# MoleGen - generative ML model for molecules

[![Molegen architecture](https://www.justin-silver.com/assets/img/molegen/flowchart.png)](https://www.justin-silver.com/posts/molegen/)

This site hosts a replicated model from the 2019 ML paper: [A Two-Step Graph Convolutional Decoder for Molecule Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03412). Here you will find various interactive widgets for visualizing model inputs/outputs, and for running inference. 

For more information on the project, please visit (my porfolio website)[https://www.justin-silver.com/posts/molegen/].
